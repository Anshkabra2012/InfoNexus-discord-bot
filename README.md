```

### Install Dependencies

## üîß Setup

### 1. Create a Discord Bot

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Click on **"New Application"** and give your bot a name (e.g., **InfoNexus**).
3. Navigate to the **"Bot"** tab on the left sidebar.
4. Click **"Add Bot"** and confirm.
5. **Copy the Bot Token** by clicking **"Copy"** under the **"TOKEN"** section. **Keep it secure!**

### 2. Invite the Bot to Your Server

1. In the Developer Portal, go to the **"OAuth2"** tab.
2. Under **"Scopes"**, select **"bot"**.
3. Under **"Bot Permissions"**, select the necessary permissions (e.g., Send Messages, Embed Links, etc.).
4. **Copy the generated URL** and paste it into your browser.
5. Select the server you want to add the bot to and authorize.

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

1. In the project directory, create a `.env` file.

```bash
touch .env
```

2. Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
TENOR_API_KEY=your_tenor_api_key
NEWS_API_KEY=your_news_api_key
OMDB_API_KEY=your_omdb_api_key
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_alpha_vantage_api_key
NASA_API_KEY=your_nasa_api_key
# Add other API keys as needed
```

> **Note:** Replace the placeholder values (`your_discord_bot_token`, etc.) with your actual API keys. Ensure that **`.env` is included in your `.gitignore`** to keep your credentials secure.

### 4. (Optional) Secure Your `.env` File

Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub.

```gitignore
.env
```
